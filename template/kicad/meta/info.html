<h2>Mezzanine Board Template</h2>

<p>This is a project template for developing a 96Boards Mezzanine board <a href="https://www.96boards.org/products/ce/">(compatible with these boards)</a>. </p>

<p>This project's <em>schematic</em> only contains the necessary connectors needed for a mezzanine board. The current connectors are <em>surface mounted</em>, which can be easily changed to <em>through hole</em>. This is noted in the schematic.</p>

<p>The <em>PCB</em> includes the connectors, and mounting holes. The <em>connectors and holes</em> have been positioned so that the boards are aligned when mounted. The <em>edge cuts</em> also aligns with the base board. All the mezzanine board <em>IO</em> is connected to the header pins.</p>

<p>The board outline looks like the following:</p>
