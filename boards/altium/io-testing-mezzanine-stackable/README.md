# I/O-Testing-Mezzanine

This is a board based on the [Altium template](../../../template/altium).

This board outputs the whole low-speed connector pins (still 1.8V) to a 2.54mm pitch.

It also is stackable, so any other mezzanine can be attached on top of it.

## What is this board for?

The purposes of this board are:

- output the low-speed connector in 2.54mm pitch
- test some GPIOs with onboard LEDs and push-buttons
- use the USB available in the high-speed connector
- output the I2C available on the high-speed connector
- be stackable
