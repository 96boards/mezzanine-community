I2S Mezzanine
-------------

Description:
------------
This is a FULLY STACKABLE sound card for 96Boards Consumer Edition SBCs.

Output:
-------
There are two stereo DACs on the board. Both are TI PCM5142 with programmable miniDSP.
U302 is the "front" channel, which can be controlled over I2C1 at address 0x4C.
U302 Line Out is routed to CONN401.
U302 is also routed to headphone amplifier TI TPA6110A2 at U501 and output at CONN501.
U501 power is controlled by insertion/removal of 3-conductor stereo headset.
U303 is the "rear" channel, which can be controlled over I2C1 at address 0x4D.
U302 Line Out is routed to CONN402.

Input:
------
The board is equipped with a 4-channel ADC, TI PCM1865 at U301.
U301 can be controlled over I2C1 at address 0x4A.
Pair 1 input is microphone biased to CONN403.
Pair 2 input is line level CONN404.
Pair 3 input is line level CONN405.
Pair 4 input is line level CONN406.

Power:
------
All audio ICs on the board require a 3.3v analog power supply, which is provided by
L4931 at U101. The state of U101 is controlled by Q101 which has its base attached to J101
pin 2. Place a jumper on pins 1-2 of J101 for power state of U101 to be controlled by GPIO-K,
Place a jumper on pins 2-3 of J101 for U101 to remain always powered (if GPIO-K is required
for another purpose).

Audio Routing:
--------------
The PCM1865 has 1 I2S input and 2 I2S outputs. Its input (GPIO1) and one of its 2
outputs (second output, GPIO0) are connected to the I2S port of the SBC's low speed connector.
Its primary output is routed to the inputs of both PCM5142's.

The PCM1865 is able to produce a total of 4 output audio channels. These can be 2 stereo outputs
routed each to one of the I2S outputs, or it can be 4 channel TDM, routed to one or the other
output, or both (in which case they are carrying the same data). Each of the 4 output channels
is a mixture of *any* combination of the 10 input channels (8 analog, 2 digital).

The PCM5142s can play either the same input data, with, for example, varying volume, or
different DSP programs (for example, normal/sub), or in TDM mode, one can play the first two
channels, and the other can play the second two channels.

Construction Options:
---------------------
If stacking of high speed connector is not required, do not install J2 or J3.
If stacking of low speed connector is not required, do not install J4.
If 4 channel output is not required, do not install;
	U303, C318-C324, R403, R409, CONN402.
If headphone amplifier is not required, do not install any component numbered 5xx.
If PCM1865 is not required to operate as CLOCK MASTER, do not install;
	U304, C332, C333.
To reduce number of Line In ports by 1, do not install;
	CONN406, C314, C315, R305, R306.
To reduce number of Line In ports by 2, also do not install;
	CONN405, C312, C313, R307, R308.
To reduce number of Line In ports by 3, also do not install;
	CONN404, C316, C317, R309, R310.

Known Limitations:
------------------
96Boards Consumer Editions specifications make I2S input *optional*. As a result, some boards
may not be equipped to receive I2S input. One such board is Dragonboard 410C, which has its
PCM-DI (pin 22) listed as NOT CONNECTED. In some cases, it may be possible to recover that
capability, if that pin happens to be routed elsewhere on the low speed connector. This
is the case for Dragonboard 410C, which happens to have the pin that otherwise would have
been connected there routed to GPIO-E (pin 27). In order to recover I2S input capability on
Dragonboard 410C, attach a jumper from pin 27 to pin 22 of the low speed header. However,
note that further work will be required in the kernel to activate this pin in I2S mode.
