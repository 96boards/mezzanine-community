### General discussion:

- Discussed putting template under public domain, though we eventually decided BSD would be best.
- To begin using the old [mezzanine mailing list](https://lists.96boards.org/mailman/listinfo/mezzanine)
   - Community Mezzanine correspondence should be sent through this list.
- New hardware suggestion
   - Add UART Serial to current proto mezzanine
   - Battery board / pack accessory
- Should we add a section for community generated accessories?
   
### Actions:

- Pull BSD license out of kicad folder and apply to all templets regardless of CAD software (ie Altium, Eagle, etc...)
- Create Template folders for Eagle and Altium
- Create a poll for the community to see which mezzanine should come next.
   
### Maintainership:

- Primary maintainer: Michael Welling
- Reviewers: Robert Wolff (General), Rafael Christ (Altium)
