# Meetings

An informal steering committee of community members will allocate resources to a variety or projects, all with a grand scope of meeting the needs of the greater 96Boards community.

- Weekly video conference meetings are open to the public on BlueJeans. Join every Monday at 3:00 UTC to take part in the discussion.
